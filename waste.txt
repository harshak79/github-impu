Winter is coming this spring. The eighth and final season of Game of Thrones starts April 14. 

In order to watch the comings and goings in Westeros as Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen and the Starks line up against the Lannisters and the Army of the Dead (and their recently acquired dragon) -- the final Battle of Winterfell is rumored to be insanely lengthy and excruciatingly bloody -- you will need a way to watch HBO. Thankfully, there are plenty of easy ways to subscribe, even if you don't have cable.
